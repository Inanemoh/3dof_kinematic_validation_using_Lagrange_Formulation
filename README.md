# 3dof_kinematic_validation_using_Lagrange_Formulation
This project presents the modeling and validation of the kinematic and dynamic behavior of a 3-link articulated robotic manipulator using the Lagrange formulation. The study focuses on:

1. Developing Forward Kinematics

2. Developing Inverse Kinematics

3. Deriving the Dynamic Model using Lagrange–Euler formulation

4. Simulating joint motions

5. Validating model accuracy using trajectory analysis and energy behavior

6. The goal is to verify the correctness, smoothness, and physical consistency of the manipulator’s motion model.

System Description

The manipulator consists of:

3 Revolute Joints (R–R–R configuration), 3 Rigid Links, Planar motion assumption, Denavit–Hartenberg (DH) convention used for kinematic modeling

How to Run

Open Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook. Include the code and run the snippets
